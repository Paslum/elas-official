## 🤓 Description

The goal of the project _“Interactive Data Exploration and Analytics”_ in the winter term of 23/24 is to further develop and implement NoteBot, which is an extension of the ELAS project aimed at helping students write notes more efficiently using AI.

NoteBot was initially developed by [Hla Abuhamra](https://github.com/HlaHusain), [Yusra Abdulrahman](https://github.com/Yusra-3033), [Hadeel Saleh](https://github.com/hadeelalzenaty-web), and [Hadil Khbaiz]() in the frame of the AWT course in summer semester 2023 but has been further/redeveloped by three separate groups during the winter semester 2022/23.
